# Better-OneNote-Math
This script was written to increase math-typing speed and allow typed notes in classes that are heavily math based.
The shortcuts present in this script were specifically written for Intro Thermodynamics and Fluid Mechanics for Chemical Engineers, broader functionality is missing.

Note:
  This script is is designed to be used in MS OneNote because of the accessibility of the program. 
  Exponents, Subscripts, lbf, lbm, and integrals may not work on other note-taking applications, but greek symbols will. 
  The shortcuts present in this script can be easily modified to fit other programs.
